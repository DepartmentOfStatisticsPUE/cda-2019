# Distributions

## The Bernoulli distribution

## The binomial distribution

## The geometric distribution


## The negative binomial distribution or Pascal distribution


$$
{\displaystyle f(k;r,p)\equiv \Pr(X=k)={\binom {r+k-1}{k}}p^{k}(1-p)^{r}}
$$

where $r$ is the number of failures, $k$ is the number of successes, and $p$ is the probability of success

## The Poisson distribution
