## Ex 1

During trening basketball player throws 10 times for 3 points. Probability of success in a single shot is 0.4. Let $X$ be random variable denoting number of accurate throw.

+ Find the distribution of $X$.
+ Create a plot for the distribution of  $X$.
+ Find probability that the player throws exactly 6 times
+ Find probability that the player throws at most 3 times

### Solutions -- R

```{r}
p <- 0.4
n <- 10
## pt 1 
dbinom(x = 0:n, n, prob = p)  ## pdf
## pt 2
barplot(dbinom(x = 0:n, n, prob = p))
## pt 3
dbinom(x = 6, n, p)
## pt 4
pbinom(3,n,p) 
```

### Solutions -- Python

```{python, engine.path = "~/anaconda3/bin/python"}
import numpy as np 
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plot
n, p = 10, 0.4 ## n=10, p=0.4
# pt 1
a = stats.binom.pmf(k = np.arange(0,n+1), n=n, p=p)
print(a)
# pt 2
plot.bar(x = np.arange(0,n+1), height = a)
# plot.show() -- to see the plot
# pt 3 
c = stats.binom.pmf(k = 6, n=n, p=p)
print(c)
# pt 4
d = stats.binom.cdf(k = 3, n=n, p=p)

### Solutions -- Julia

```{julia, engine.path = "/Applications/Julia-1.0.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia"}
using Distributions ## for distributions
n, p = 10, 0.4;
# pt  1
a = pdf.(Binomial(n, p), 0:n) ## we need to use pdf. instead of pdf because 0:n is vector
print(a)
# pt 2

# pt 3
c = pdf(Binomial(n, p), 6)
print(c)
# pt 4
c = cdf(Binomial(n, p), 3) 
print(c)
```
